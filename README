# üìç **Introduction**
In the past couple of months, there have been several high-profile layoffs that occurred in tech companies in a wide range of industries, from media and entertainment to cybersecurity and fintechs, which raises questions about the stability of the industry. It's a very delicate situation and I feel sorry for those who were impacted, but I believe that it's important to analyze the data about these facts to be able to prepare myself and others for the future.

### üéØ **Purpose and Objective**
The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset regarding the layoff announcements from tech companies that happened in recent months. The main research objective is to:
- Understand the trends
- Try to find any patterns
- Analyze which industries were more affected
- Analyze the percentage of labor affected. 

This notebook will contain some analysis to comprehend the data, but the "full analysis" will be available in Power BI.

### üìë **Methodology**
For this project, the following tools will be used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Power BI

### üìö **Used Dataset**
The dataset that will be used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. I appreciate [Widya Salim](https://www.kaggle.com/salimwid) for making this data available to use.
